# ***ðŸ’³ Credit Card Default Prediction***
This is a binary classification problem.In this we have to predict whether the user of credit card will default on the payment in next month or not.
An api using streamlit has been created,with the help of the api we can take input data and do the prediction.

For information about dataset and project check the jupyter file and html file present in the notebook folder in the github repository of this project.
