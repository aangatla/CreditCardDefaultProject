# ***ðŸ’³ Credit Card Default Prediction***
This is a binary classification problem.In this we have to predict whether the user of credit card will default on the payment in next month or not.
An api using streamlit has been created,with the help of the api we can take input data and do the prediction.

For information about dataset and project check the jupyter file and html file present in the notebook folder in the github repository of this project.

# **API**



# **Installation guide**

Step1:Install the setup.py file:
pip install .

While installing the setup.py file the current working directory
should be the same as that setup.py file.

Step2: Run the streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py




# ***How to do the Predictions using API***

Step1: Go to the following url:

Step2: Insert the file at the required location

Step3: Wait for the prediction.

For making it easier for testing the model I have provided
some test files in the github repository of this
project.You can download one of those csv files and
can use them for testing the app.
